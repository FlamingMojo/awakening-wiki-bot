              Hello,

              A user on the %{SITE_NAME} Discord server is attempting to verify ownership of the wiki user %{wiki_username}.
              The discord username is %{discord_username} and ID %{discord_id}. 
              If this is you, please return to the %{SITE_NAME} Discord server and use the command '/wiki_user verify' with the below code:

              %{token}

              Thanks for contributing to the wiki!
          success: >
            Sent a verification code to the email address connected to %{wiki_username}.
            Please enter this code into '/wiki_user verify' to complete verification.
          failure: "Sorry, there was a problem - please check the username spelling and that you have a linked email address."
          ongoing_claim: >
            You are already in the process of claiming %{ongoing_claim_username}.
            Use '/wiki_user cancel' to cancel verification.
        lookup:
          not_found: "Sorry, that user has not verified any wiki accounts."
          found: "<@%{user_id}> Has verified ownership of the following wiki accounts:\n %{wiki_usernames}"
        verify:
          no_claim: >
            You do not have an open verification for a wiki username.
            Use '/wiki_user claim' to start verifying your ownership of a wiki user.
            Please make sure you have an email associated to the account!
          already_claimed: "%{wiki_username} has already been verified as <@%{discord_id}>"
          incorrect_code: "Sorry, that code is not correct."
          success: "Successfully verified ownership of %{wiki_username}."
